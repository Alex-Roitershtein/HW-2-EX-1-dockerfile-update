Our group worked together to complete this assignment by organizing a scheduled meeting with all members of the group. Then, we reviewed the assignment and decided it would be best to debug the dockerfile in person together. In order to debug, we first checked the imports and modified them to their newest version, then we ran the file and noticed there were dependency issues. 
After we read the corresponding errors, we realized taht some dependencies needed to be certain versions. Therefore, we chose versions that met all the requirements for all other dependencies. We did this for every error that occured until there weren't anymore.
Then we reran the dockerfile, retested Jupyter Notebook, restarted the kernel, and ran all the cells until all dependencies worked together and all cells could run without errors. Finally, Kim, whose laptop we worked on, created a pull request with the updated dockerfile.
