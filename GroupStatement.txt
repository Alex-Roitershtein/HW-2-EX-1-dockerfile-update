Our group worked together to complete this assignment by organizing a scheduled meeting with all members of the group. Then, we reviewed the assignment and decided it would be best to debug the dockerfile in person together. In order to debug, we first checked the imports and modified them to their newest version, then we ran the file and noticed there were dependency issues.
